# My Personal Project

## MadeForMe Skincare 

This project is the design of a self-guided marketing platform called 
**MadeForMe Skincare**. With the intention of being implemented in online shopping
sites, this program will allow users to create a unique skincare 
routine by answering a questionnaire and selecting suggested items
of interest to add to their shopping cart. The application will filter the user's results 
to recommend products that address the users individual needs. 

The design of this program is targeted to those familiar with skincare products as well as 
those who are not; by answering simple questions, MadeForMe allows everyone 
to buy the right products for their skin. To model how this program would
be used by a skincare company, I will be using The Ordinary brand as a database
as it is inexpensive and accessible. Please note that MadeForMe can be used to recommend
a number of different brands individually or in combination with others. 

Growing up, I've realized that skincare can be complicated, not to mention a 
source of vulnerability for young adults. I've tried a number of different products 
before finding the right fit, so I'm creating a program that will remove the 
excess time and money in this process so others can feel confident in their skin from day one.
